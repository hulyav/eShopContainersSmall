# eShopContainersSmall
The infamous dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers (MIT License) solution was divided into more granular microservices

## Overview of the application code
In this repo you can find a sample reference application that will help you to understand how to implement a microservice architecture based application using <b>.NET Core</b> and <b>Docker</b>.

The example business domain or scenario is based on an eShop or eCommerce which is implemented as a multi-container application. Each container is a microservice deployment (like the basket-microservice, catalog-microservice, ordering-microservice and the  identity-microservice) which are developed using ASP.NET Core running on .NET Core so they can run either on Linux Containers and Windows Containers.
The screenshot below shows the VS Solution structure for those microservices/containers and client apps.

- (*Recommended when getting started*) Open <b>eShopOnContainers-ServicesAndWebApps.sln</b> for a solution containing just the server-side projects related to the microservices and web applications.
- Open <b>eShopOnContainers-MobileApps.sln</b> for a solution containing just the client mobile app projects (Xamarin mobile apps only). It works independently based on mocks, too.
- Open <b>eShopOnContainers.sln</b> for a solution containing all the projects (All client apps and services).

Finally, those microservices are consumed by multiple client web and mobile apps, as described below.
<br>
<b>*MVC Application (ASP.NET Core)*</b>: It's an MVC application where you can find interesting scenarios on how to consume HTTP-based microservices from C# running in the server side, as it is a typical ASP.NET Core MVC application. Since it is a server-side application, access to other containers/microservices is done within the internal Docker Host network with its internal name resolution.

<br>
<b>*SPA (Single Page Application)*</b>: Providing similar "eShop business functionality" but developed with Angular, Typescript and slightly using ASP.NET Core MVC. This is another approach for client web applications to be used when you want to have a more modern client behavior which is not behaving with the typical browser round-trip on every action but behaving like a Single-Page-Application which is more similar to a desktop app usage experience. The consumption of the HTTP-based microservices is done from TypeScript/JavaScript in the client browser, so the client calls to the microservices come from out of the Docker Host internal network (Like from your network or even from the Internet).

<br>
<b>*Xamarin Mobile App (For iOS, Android and Windows/UWP)*</b>: It is a client mobile app supporting the most common mobile OS platforms (iOS, Android and Windows/UWP). In this case, the consumption of the microservices is done from C# but running on the client devices, so out of the Docker Host internal network (Like from your network or even the Internet).

## Setting up your development environment for eShopOnContainers
### Visual Studio 2017 and Windows based
This is the more straightforward way to get started:
